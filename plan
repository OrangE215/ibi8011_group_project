Questions:
1. What format should the input DNA be?
2. Do we put in a section of DNA or a whole piece of DNA, and if it's a whole piece of DNA, do we need to split it, split it according to what principle?

Plan:
  task1- Liang_xiaoran
  task2- Ye_guobiao
  task3- Li_yicheng
  task4- Zhou_congtai
  task5- Gu_zhaoyu
    Do FOXL1 and FOXC1 have overlapping binding sites? If so, try to print all overlapping binding sites.

# Treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D)

Your team developed an insulinomimetic that can be used to substitute insulin in patients with T1D. You induced T1D in mice by injecting them with streptozotocin (this drug destroys pancreatic $\beta$-cells, which abrogates insulin production and leads to the loss of control over glucose metabolism). Subsequently, mice were injected with vehicle or this novel drug in 2 possible concentrations. Their blood glucose level (mM) was measured before the injection and 1 hour after.

Answer the questions below and provide clear and reproducible code as well as your comments.

## Import, check, and organize the data appropriately. Treat data and reformat columns if needed.

```{r}
data = read.csv("t1d_drug.csv")

anyNA(data)
data = na.omit(data)
anyDuplicated(data)
```

## Plot the data in a useful way.

```{r}
a = data[data$Treatment=="1 mg/ml",]
b = data[data$Treatment=="5 mg/ml",]
c = data[data$Treatment=="Vehicle",]
boxplot(a$Glucose,b$Glucose,c$Glucose)
ggplot(a,b,c,aes(x=Treatment, y =Glucose, fill=Measurement)) +  geom_boxplot()


ggplot(data,aes(x=Treatment, y =Glucose, fill=Measurement)) +  geom_boxplot()
```

## Choose, justify, state the statistical hypotheses, and carry out an appropriate test to answer whether the drug is useful.

hypotheses: H0: There is no differences in the Glucose_after group HA: There is differences in the Glucose_after group

use Anova

first check the normality

```{r}
shapiro.test(data1$Glucose)
```

```{r}
data1 = data[data$Measurement=="Glucose_after",]
aov1 <- aov(Glucose~Treatment, data = data1) 
aov1
summary(aov1)
```

```{r}
data2 = data[data$Measurement=="Glucose_before",]
aov2 <- aov(Glucose~Treatment, data = data2) 
aov2
summary(aov2)
```

## Present and discuss your results. Is this novel drug useful? What would you suggest doing next?
